Creating a basic calculator using python.

to open this file, first thing you will be needing is a python editor i suggest downloading jetBrains Pycharm Community Editor.created
created 3 variables to get the users input.so 2 number inputs and 1 operator input.
using float function,so whatever the user inputs it has to be a number or the user will get an error.
using if statements to check the conditions
so whatever operator you are using it will print out the answer for.
used else statement-if you input something thats not part of the operator,the user will get an error.

so basically you will give your first number ,choose any operator you want to use and give your second number,this code will do the calculation for you.
